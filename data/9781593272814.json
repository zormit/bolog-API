Land of Lisp brings the language into the real world, teaching readers Lisp by showing them how to write several complete Lisp-based games, including a text adventure, an evolution simulation, and a robot battle. While building these games, readers learn the core concepts of Lisp programming, such as recursion, input/output, object-oriented programming, and macros. And thanks to Lisp's powerful syntax, the example code is short and easy to understand. The book is filled with the author's brilliant Lisp cartoons, which are sure to appeal to many Lisp fans and, in the tradition of all No Starch Press titles, make learning more fun.", "book_id": "land_of_lisp_a01", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2010-10-15", "subject_ids": ["computers_internet_programming_game_programming", "computers_internet_programming_graphics_multimedia_general", "computers_internet_programming_languages_tools_lisp", "computers_internet_programming_general"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781593272814", "physical_description_text": "504 pages", "title_latin": "Land of Lisp", "author_data": [], "title": "Land of Lisp", "shelf": "5.4"}
