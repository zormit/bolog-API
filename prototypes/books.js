However, the belief that all great design is nonetheless based on grid systems (even if only subverted ones) suggests that few designers truly understand the complexities and potential riches of grid composition. In her best-selling Geometry of Design, Elam shows how proportion, symmetry, and other geometrical systems underlie many of the visual relationships that make for good design. Now, Elam brings the same keen eye and clear explanations to bear on the most prevalent, and maybe least understood, system of visual organization: the grid. Filled with extensive research and more than 100 informative examples from the Bauhaus to Nike ads, Grid Systems provides a rich, easy-to-understand overview and demonstrates a step-by-step approach to typographic composition. It suggests design strategies that transcend simple function and reductionist recipes to allow grids to become a means of truly dynamic communication.

Today, parsing techniques are also implemented in a number of other disciplines, including but not limited to, document preparation and conversion, typesetting chemical formulae, and chromosome recognition. This second edition presents new developments and discoveries that have been made in the field. Parsing techniques have grown considerably in importance, both in computational linguistics where such parsers are the only option, and computer science, where advanced compilers often use general CF parsers. Parsing techniques provide a solid basis for compiler construction and contribute to all existing software: enabling Web browsers to analyze HTML pages and PostScript printers to analyze PostScript. Some of the more advanced techniques are used in code generation in compilers and in data compression. In linguistics, the importance of formal grammars was recognized early on, but only recently have the corresponding parsing techniques been applied. Also their importance as general pattern recognizers is slowly being acknowledged. This text Parsing Techniques explores new developments, such as generalized deterministic parsing, linear-time substring parsing, parallel parsing, parsing as intersection, non-canonical methods, and non-Chomsky systems. To provide readers with low-threshold access to the full field of parsing techniques, this new edition uses a two-tiered structure. The basic ideas behind the dozen or so existing parsing techniques are explained in an intuitive and narrative style, and problems are presented at the conclusion of each chapter, allowing the reader to step outside the bounds of the covered material and explore parsing techniques at various levels. The reader is also provided with an extensive annotated bibliography as well as hints and partial solutions to a number of problems. In the bibliography, hundreds of realizations and improvements of parsing techniques are explained in a much terser, yet still informal, style, improving its readability and usability.

In Core HTML5 Canvas, best-selling author David Geary presents a code-fueled, no-nonsense deep dive into that API, covering everything you need to know to implement rich and consistent web applications that run on a wide variety of operating systems and devices. Succinctly and clearly written, this book examines dozens of real-world uses of the Canvas API, such as interactively drawing and manipulating shapes, saving and restoring the drawing surface to temporarily draw shapes and text, and implementing text controls. You'll see how to keep your applications responsive with web workers when you filter images, how to implement smooth animations, and how to create layered, 3D scrolling backgrounds with parallax. In addition, you'll see how to implement video games with extensive coverage of sprites, physics, collision detection, and the implementation of a game engine and an industrial-strength pinball game. The book concludes by showing you how to implement Canvas-based controls that you can use in any HTML5 application and how to use Canvas on mobile devices, including iOS5. This authoritative Canvas reference covers The canvas element--using it with other HTML elements, handling events, printing a canvas, and using offscreen canvases Shapes--drawing, dragging, erasing, and editing lines, arcs, circles, curves, and polygons; using shadows, gradients, and patterns Text--drawing, positioning, setting font properties; building text controls Images--drawing, scaling, clipping, processing, and animating Animations--creating smooth, efficient, and portable animations Sprites--implementing animated objects that have painters and behaviors Physics--modeling physical systems (falling bodies, pendulums, and projectiles), and implementing tweening for nonlinear motion and animation Collision detection--advanced techniques, clearly explained Game development--all aspects of game development, such as time-based motion and high score support, implemented in a game engine Custom controls--infrastructure for implementing custom controls; implementing progress bars, sliders, and an image panner Mobile applications--fitting Canvas apps on a mobile screen, using media queries, handling touch events, and specifying iOS5 artifacts, such as app icons Throughout the book, Geary discusses high-quality, reusable code to help professional developers learn everything they really need to know, with no unnecessary verbiage.

Everest to newcomers. Developing technical skills is vital, but there are dozens of soft skills and learning techniques you need if you're to grow and succeed professionally. Honing those soft skills is a big part of what Apprenticeship Patterns is all about. Authors Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye, both formerly of the global IT consultancy ThoughtWorks, have cataloged dozens of patterns of behavior to help software developers hone their craft. Developed through years of research, a multitude of interviews, and feedback from O'Reilly's online forum, these patterns address difficult situations faced by entry-level programmers, system administrators, and database administrators. Each pattern has a memorable name to help point you in the right direction when you need it most. Examples of common obstacles and their solutions include: Burned out at work? Learn how to \"Nurture Your Passion\" by finding a pet project to help you rediscover the joy of problem solving Feeling overwhelmed by too much new information? Take a step back from your learning to re-explore some familiar territory by building something you've built before, then use \"Retreat Into Competence\" to launch yourself forward again Feeling stuck in your learning? Seek out a team of experienced and talented developers where you can \"Be the Worst\" for a while Like any patterns book, you can read this one front-to-back, jump to specific patterns when you encounter the issues they address, or cherry pick just the ones that are new to you. The purpose of the solutions is to inspire you to stay on the path you intend, rather than wander off into management because it seems like the only option for advancement.

Grenning shows embedded software developers how to bring the benefits of TDD to embedded C. In the book, you'll see how to apply TDD to C and the world of embedded software development. Learn how to break key dependencies, allowing code to be tested thoroughly. Explore how to test-drive your product's core logic, exploiting the power of your development environment to deliver better software. In fact, as the book shows, you can test-drive a device driver before you even have the device soldered into a circuit board. Avoid the natural delays when testing on the target by using the tailored TDD Microcycle, employing off-target tests and dual-targeted code. Learn how to make code testable and more flexible, better able to handle the inevitable changes demanded by the market. The tests drive development and then serve as an executable specification, keeping track of the critical details and assumptions baked into the code. In Test Driven Development for Embedded C, you'll find that TDD is a different way to program-unit tests are written in a tight feedback loop with the production code, producing testable code and greatly reducing wasteful debugging. TDD also influences design. When tests are considered part of design, you create modular and loosely coupled code, the hallmarks of a good design.

But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist. First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery, a simple ninety-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third. In riveting stories, Gawande takes us from Austria, where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater, to Michigan, where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements. And he follows the checklist revolution into fields well beyond medicine, from disaster response to investment banking, skyscraper construction, and businesses of all kinds.

Owning a word like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is empowering at any age. If you have ever been completely wowed by the power you can have over language, or its power over you, Richard Lederer is your patron saint. His oft-reprinted introduction to Crazy English, which was originally published in 1989, claims that English is \"the most loopy and wiggy of all tongues.\" And then he demonstrates: \"In what other language do people drive in a parkway and park in a driveway? ... Why do they call them apartments when they're all together?\" And so on. Lederer's pace is frenetic. He alights on oxymorons (\"pretty ugly,\" \"computer jock\"), redundancies, confusing words (are you sure you know the meaning of enormity?), phobias, contronyms, heteronyms, retroactive terms (acoustic guitar, rotary phone), and a host of other linguistic delights. Though English may be one of the crazier languages--Lederer claims that about 80 percent of our words are not spelled phonetically--they are all, he says, a little crazy. \"That's because language is invented ... by boys and girls and men and women, not computers.

Recently, however, players have been gravitating to another, even more complex form of hold em no-limit cash games.

You ll learn how to tailor your selection of starting hands to your stack size, how to recognize the increasing deception value of supposedly weaker hands as the stack sizes increase, and how to use the concept of pot commitment to your advantage as the size of the pot grows. After laying out the general concepts behind deep-stack cash game play, Harrington shows you a complete strategy for post-flop play, and then teaches you the difference between post-flop play against a single opponent and post-flop play against multiple opponents. If you play no-limit hold em cash games, you need to read this book. Dan Harrington won the gold bracelet and the World Champion title at the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold em Championship at the 1995 World Series of Poker. And he was the only player to make the final table in 2003 (field of 839) and 2004 (field of 2,576) considered by cognoscenti to be the greatest accomplishment in WSOP history. In Harrington on Cash Games, Harrington and two-time World Backgammon Champion Bill Robertie have written the definitive books on no-limit cash games.

Written for professionals and students with some prior programming experience, it begins by leading the programmer gently through the basics of Scheme and continues with an introduction to some of the more advanced features of the language. The fourth edition has been substantially revised and expanded to bring the content up to date with the current Scheme standard, the Revised6 Report on Scheme. All parts of the book were updated and three new chapters were added, covering the language's new library, exception handling, and record-definition features. The book offers three chapters of introductory material with numerous examples, eight chapters of reference material, and one chapter of extended examples and additional exercises. All of the examples can be entered directly from the keyboard into an interactive Scheme session. Answers to many of the exercises, a complete formal syntax of Scheme, and a summary of forms and procedures are provided in appendixes.

The book extracts fundamental ideas and algorithmic principles from the mass of parallel algorithm expertise and practical implementations developed over the last few decades. In the first section of the text, the authors cover two classical theoretical models of parallel computation (PRAMs and sorting networks), describe network models for topology and performance, and define several classical communication primitives. The next part deals with parallel algorithms on ring and grid logical topologies as well as the issue of load balancing on heterogeneous computing platforms. The final section presents basic results and approaches for common scheduling problems that arise when developing parallel algorithms. It also discusses advanced scheduling topics, such as divisible load scheduling and steady-state scheduling.

It's a beautifully written tutorial that begins with the basic steps to get your first Ruby program up and running and goes on to explore sophisticated topics like callable objects, reflection, and threading. Whether the topic is simple or tough, the book's easy-to-follow examples and explanations will give you immediate confidence as you build your Ruby programming skills. The Well-Grounded Rubyist is a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the best-selling Ruby for Rails. In this new book, expert author David A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view of Ruby. It covers Ruby 1.9, and keeps the same sharp focus and clear writing that made Ruby for Rails stand out. Starting with the basics, The Well-Grounded Rubyist explains Ruby objects and their interactions from the ground up. In the middle chapters, the book turns to an examination of Ruby's built-in, core classes, showing the reader how to manipulate strings, numbers, arrays, ranges, hashes, sets, and more. Regular expressions get attention, as do file and other I/O operations. Along the way, the reader is introduced to numerous tools included in the standard Ruby distribution--tools like the task manager Rake and the interactive Ruby console-based interpreter Irb--that facilitate Ruby development and make it an integrated and pleasant experience. The book encompasses advanced topics, like the design of Ruby's class and module system, and the use of Ruby threads, taking even the new Rubyist deep into the language and giving every reader the foundations necessary to use, explore, and enjoy this unusually popular and versatile language.

The novel, divided into three books, opens in 1713 with the ageless Enoch Root seeking Daniel Waterhouse on the campus of what passes for MIT in eighteenth-century Massachusetts. Daniel, Enoch's message conveys, is key to resolving an explosive scientific battle of preeminence between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the development of calculus. As Daniel returns to London aboard the Minerva, readers are catapulted back half a century to recall his years at Cambridge with young Isaac. Daniel is a perfect historical witness. Privy to Robert Hooke's early drawings of microscope images and with associates among the English nobility, religious radicals, and the Royal Society, he also befriends Samuel Pepys, risks a cup of coffee, and enjoys a lecture on Belgian waffles and cleavage-?all before the year 1700. In the second book, Stephenson introduces Jack Shaftoe and Eliza. \"Half-Cocked\" Jack (also know as the \"King of the Vagabonds\") recovers the English Eliza from a Turkish harem. Fleeing the siege of Vienna, the two journey across Europe driven by Eliza's lust for fame, fortune, and nobility. Gradually, their circle intertwines with that of Daniel in the third book of the novel. The book courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down in its historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory. Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. But, caught in this richness, the prose is occasionally neglected and wants editing. Further, anticipating a cycle, the book does not provide a satisfying conclusion to its 900 pages. These are minor quibbles, though. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics. --Patrick O'Kelley", "title_latin": "Quicksilver", "physical_description_text": "960 pages", "language": "", "category": "fiction", "authors": "Stephenson, Neal", "book_id": "quicksilver_a10", "marc_enc_level": "~", "publisher_name": "Harper Perennial", "publisher_id": "harper_perennial", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9780060593087", "notes": ""}, {"subject_ids": ["childrens_books_education_reference", "computers_technology_programming_introductory_beginning", "computers_technology_programming_languages_tools_python", "computers_technology_programming_software_design_testi_aaaa0"], "awards_text": "", "lcc_number": "", "dewey_normal": "5", "isbn10": "1593274076", "dewey_decimal": "005", "publisher_text": "No Starch Press", "title_long": "Python for Kids: A Playful Introduction to Programming", "topic": "python", "shelf": "8.2", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2012-03-28", "title": "Python for Kids", "author_data": [{"id": "jason_briggs", "name": "Jason Briggs"}], "isbn13": "9781593274078", "title_latin": "Python for Kids", "summary": "Python for Kids is a lighthearted introduction to the Python language and programming in general, complete with illustrations and kid-friendly examples.

The book focuses the discussion of operating systems on the microkernel operating system facilities used in embedded systems. Rather than introduce a new course to teach the important topics of embedded systems programming, this textbook takes the approach of integrating more embedded processing into existing operating systems courses. Designed for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses, the book prepares students for the increased demand for operating system expertise in industry. Highlights Explains how each operating system abstraction can be built and shows how the abstractions can be organized into an elegant, efficient design Considers each level of the system individually, beginning with the raw hardware and ending with a working operating system Covers every part of the system, so a reader will see how an entire system fits together, not merely how one or two parts interact Provides source code for all pieces described in the text, leaving no mystery about any part of the implementation \ufffd a reader can obtain a copy of the system to examine, modify, instrument, measure, extend, or transport to another architecture Demonstrates how each piece of an operating system fits into the design, in order to prepare the reader to understand alternative design choices Beginning with the underlying machine and proceeding step by step through the design and implementation of an actual system, Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach, Linksys Version guides readers through the construction of a traditional process-based operating system using practical, straightforward primitives. It reviews the major system components and imposes a hierarchical design paradigm that organizes the components in an orderly and understandable manner. All of the code in the book is designed to run on the Linksys router, because it is small, inexpensive, and easily accessible to students.

Gilly starts with a complete, alphabetized listing of core Unix commands. Each entry includes a syntax summary, a clear statement of what the command does, and a full list of options, each with commentary on its function. The author then covers shell documentation, supplying details on the Bourne, Korn, and C shells and documenting each shell's commands in the standard format. Gilly also includes a section on regular expressions as they apply to grep, egrep, text editors, and various scripting languages. Next, the book offers complete documentation of Emacs, ex, and vi, the powerful editors whose command structure proves perennially difficult to learn. The commands, once again, appear alphabetically with statements of their respective purposes. Other popular utilities--sed, awk, nroff, troff, tbl, and several macro languages--follow. Code managers SCCS and RCS, rarely documented in Unix books, bring up the rear. Users need to know what they're looking up or they won't find this book useful.

Clojure's clean, careful design lets you write programs that get right to the essence of a problem, without a lot of clutter and ceremony. Clojure is Lisp reloaded. Clojure has the power inherent in Lisp, but is not constrained by the history of Lisp. Clojure is a functional language. Data structures are immutable, and functions tend to be side-effect free. This makes it easier to write correct programs, and to compose large programs from smaller ones. Clojure is concurrent. Rather than error-prone locking, Clojure provides software transactional memory. Clojure embraces Java. Calling from Clojure to Java is direct, and goes through no translation layer. Clojure is fast. Wherever you need it, you can get the exact same performance that you could get from hand-written Java code. Many other languages offer some of these features, but the combination of them all makes Clojure sparkle.

With Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, Seven Languages hits what's essential and unique about each language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages. For each language, you'll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the language's most important features. As the book proceeds, you'll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quickly--for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them. Among this group of seven, you'll explore the most critical programming models of our time. Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system that's at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure. Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use Erlang's let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala. Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems. It's all here, all in one place. Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.", "physical_description_text": "300 pages", "language": "", "category": "languages", "authors": "Tate, Bruce", "book_id": "seven_languages_in_seven_weeks", "marc_enc_level": "~", "publisher_name": "Pragmatic Bookshelf", "publisher_id": "pragmatic_bookshelf", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9781934356593", "notes": ""}, {"subject_ids": ["web_site_development1", "html_document_markup_language1", "cascading_style_sheets1", "javascript_computer_program_language1", "portable_computers1", "browsers_computer_programs1"], "awards_text": "; ", "lcc_number": "TK5105.888", "dewey_normal": "6.76", "isbn10": "1593274874", "dewey_decimal": "006.7/6", "publisher_text": "San Francisco; No Starch Press", "title_long": "The modern Webmulti-device Web development with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript", "topic": "web", "shelf": "9.1", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "; ", "title": "The modern Web", "author_data": [{"id": "peter_gasston", "name": "Peter Gasston"}, {"id": "storey_david", "name": "Storey, David"}], "title_latin": "The modern Web", "summary": "", "physical_description_text": "", "language": "eng", "category": "platforms", "authors": "Peter Gasston & Storey, David", "book_id": "the_modern_web1", "marc_enc_level": "", "publisher_name": "No Starch Press", "publisher_id": "no_starch_press", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9781593274870", "notes": "Title from title screen.; Includes bibliographical references.; Text (Electronic book)"}, {"subject_ids": ["computers_internet_home_computing_internet_general", "computers_internet_programming_general"], "awards_text": "", "lcc_number": "", "dewey_normal": "0", "isbn10": "1935182641", "dewey_decimal": "", "publisher_text": "Manning Publications", "title_long": "", "topic": "clojure", "shelf": "5.4", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2010-11-30", "title": "The Joy of Clojure", "author_data": [{"id": "michael_fogus", "name": "Michael Fogus"}, {"id": "chris_houser", "name": "Chris Houser"}], "isbn13": "9781935182641", "summary": "Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine.

The text-command based GDB (the GNU Project Debugger) is included with most distributions. DDD is a popular GUI front end for GDB, while Eclipse provides a complete integrated development environment. In addition to offering specific advice for debugging with each tool, authors Norm Matloff and Pete Salzman cover general strategies for improving the process of finding and fixing coding errors, including how to: Inspect variables and data structures Understand segmentation faults and core dumps Know why your program crashes or throws exceptions Use features like catchpoints, convenience variables, and artificial arrays Avoid common debugging pitfalls Real world examples of coding errors help to clarify the authors' guiding principles, and coverage of complex topics like thread, client-server, GUI, and parallel programming debugging will make you even more proficient. You'll also learn how to prevent errors in the first place with text editors, compilers, error reporting, and static code checkers.

Their insights may surprise you. Are some programmers really ten times more productive than others? Does writing tests first help you develop better code faster? Can code metrics predict the number of bugs in a piece of software? Do design patterns actually make better software? What effect does personality have on pair programming?

By taking the reader through exercises, student work, and professional examples, Elam offers a broad range of design solutions. Once essential visual organization systems are understood the designer can fluidly organize words or images within a structure, combination of structures, or a variation of a structure. With clarity and substance, each system \ufffd from the structured axis to the nonhierarchical radial array \ufffd is explained and explored so that the reader comes away with a better understanding of these intricate complex arrangements.

The Web is awash in Ruby code that is now virtually impossible to change or extend. This text helps you solve that problem by using powerful real-world object-oriented design techniques, which it thoroughly explains using simple and practical Ruby examples. Sandi Metz has distilled a lifetime of conversations and presentations about object-oriented design into a set of Ruby-focused practices for crafting manageable, extensible, and pleasing code. She shows you how to build new applications that can survive success and repair existing applications that have become impossible to change. Each technique is illustrated with extended examples, all downloadable from the companion Web site, poodr.info. The first title to focus squarely on object-oriented Ruby application design, Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby will guide you to superior outcomes, whatever your previous Ruby experience. Novice Ruby programmers will find specific rules to live by; intermediate Ruby programmers will find valuable principles they can flexibly interpret and apply; and advanced Ruby programmers will find a common language they can use to lead development and guide their colleagues. This guide will help you Understand how object-oriented programming can help you craft Ruby code that is easier to maintain and upgrade Decide what belongs in a single Ruby class Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate Define flexible interfaces among objects Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing Successfully apply inheritance Build objects via composition Design cost-effective tests Solve common problems associated with poorly designed Ruby code", "title_latin": "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer", "physical_description_text": "6.9\"x9.0\"x0.6\"; 1.1 lb; 272 pages", "language": "", "category": "languages", "authors": "Sandi Metz", "book_id": "practical_object_oriented_design_in_ruby_an_agile_primer", "marc_enc_level": "~", "publisher_name": "Addison-Wesley Professional", "publisher_id": "addison_wesley_professional", "copies": 1, "notes": ""}, {"subject_ids": ["cinematography_history", "motion_pictures_great_britain_history"], "awards_text": "", "lcc_number": "", "dewey_normal": "0", "isbn10": "041511750X", "dewey_decimal": "", "publisher_text": "London ; Routledge, 1996.", "title_long": "The dream that kicks: the prehistory and early years of cinema in Britain", "topic": "fiction", "shelf": "1.-1", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "(pbk.)", "title": "The dream that kicks", "author_data": [{"id": "chanan_michael", "name": "Chanan, Michael"}], "summary": "", "title_latin": "dream that kicks", "physical_description_text": "xiii, 293 p. ; 22 cm.", "language": "eng", "category": "fiction", "authors": "Chanan, Michael", "book_id": "the_dream_that_kicks_a01", "marc_enc_level": "", "publisher_name": "Routledge", "publisher_id": "routledge", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9780415117500", "notes": "Includes bibliographical references and index."}, {"subject_ids": ["web_sites_design", "web_sites_evaluation"], "awards_text": "", "lcc_number": "", "dewey_normal": "0", "isbn10": "0321344758", "dewey_decimal": "", "publisher_text": "Berkeley, Calif. : New Riders, c2006.", "title_long": "Don't make me think!: a common sense approach to web usability", "topic": "design", "shelf": "3.2", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "", "title": "Don't make me think!", "language": "eng", "summary": "", "title_latin": "Don't make me think!", "physical_description_text": "xiii, 201 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.", "author_data": [{"id": "krug_steve", "name": "Krug, Steve"}], "category": "other subjects", "authors": "Krug, Steve", "book_id": "dont_make_me_think_a_common_sense_approach_to_web_usability", "marc_enc_level": "", "publisher_name": "New Riders", "publisher_id": "new_riders", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9780321344755", "notes": "Previous ed.: 2000.\n\nIncludes bibliographical references and index."}, {"subject_ids": ["computers_internet_programming_languages_tools", "computers_internet_programming_software_design_testing_engin", "computers_internet_computer_science_software_engineering", "agile_software_development", "computer_software_reliability"], "awards_text": "", "lcc_number": "QA76.76", "dewey_normal": "5.1", "isbn10": "0132350882", "dewey_decimal": "005.1", "publisher_text": "Indianapolis, Ind. : Prentice Hall ; c2009.", "title_long": "Clean code: a handbook of agile software craftsmanship", "topic": "style/technique", "shelf": "2.3", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "(pbk.)", "title": "Clean code", "author_data": [{"id": "martin_robert_w_t", "name": "Martin, Robert W.

This is a deeply technical book and focuses on the software engineering skills to ace your interview. The book is over 500 pages and includes 150 programming interview questions and answers, as well as other advice. The full list of topics are as follows:The Interview ProcessThis section offers an overview on questions are selected and how you will be evaluated. What happens when you get a question wrong? When should you start preparing, and how? What language should you use? All these questions and more are answered.Behind the ScenesLearn what happens behind the scenes during your interview, how decisions really get made, who you interview with, and what they ask you. Companies covered include Google, Amazon, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook.Special SituationsThis section explains the process for experience candidates, Program Managers, Dev Managers, Testers / SDETs, and more. Learn what your interviewers are looking for and how much code you need to know.Before the InterviewIn order to ace the interview, you first need to get an interview. This section describes what a software engineer's resume should look like and what you should be doing well before your interview.Behavioral PreparationAlthough most of a software engineering interview will be technical, behavioral questions matter too. This section covers how to prepare for behavioral questions and how to give strong, structured responses.Technical Questions (+ 5 Algorithm Approaches)This section covers how to prepare for technical questions (without wasting your time) and teaches actionable ways to solve the trickiest algorithm problems. It also teaches you what exactly \"good coding\" is when it comes to an interview.150 Programming Questions and AnswersThis section forms the bulk of the book. Each section opens with a discussion of the core knowledge and strategies to tackle this type of question, diving into exactly how you break down and solve it.

Valvano"}], "summary": "Embedded systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. The ARM\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3 is represents the new class of microcontroller much more powerful than the devices available ten years ago. The purpose of this book is to present the design methodology to train young engineers to understand the basic building blocks that comprise devices like a cell phone, an MP3 player, a pacemaker, antilock brakes, and an engine controller. This book is the third in a series of three books that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to the ARM\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3. This third volume is primarily written for senior undergraduate or first-year graduate electrical and computer engineering students. It could also be used for professionals wishing to design or deploy a real-time operating system onto an Arm platform. The first book Embedded Systems: Introduction to the ARM Cortex-M3 is an introduction to computers and interfacing focusing on assembly language and C programming. The second book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to the ARM Cortex-M3 focuses on interfacing and the design of embedded systems. This third book is an advanced book focusing on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics. Rather than buying and deploying an existing OS, the focus is on fundamental principles, so readers can write their-own OS. An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. A system is comprised of components and interfaces connected together for a common purpose. Specific topics include microcontrollers, design, verification, hardware/software synchronization, interfacing devices to the computer, real-time operating systems, data collection and processing, motor control, analog filters, digital filters, and real-time signal processing. This book employs many approaches to learning. It will not include an exhaustive recapitulation of the information in data sheets. First, it begins with basic fundamentals, which allows the reader to solve new problems with new technology. Second, the book presents many detailed design examples. These examples illustrate the process of design. There are multiple structural components that assist learning. Checkpoints, with answers in the back, are short easy to answer questions providing immediate feedback while reading. Simple homework, with answers to the odd questions on the web, provides more detailed learning opportunities. The book includes an index and a glossary so that information can be searched. The most important learning experiences in a class like this are of course the laboratories. Each chapter has suggested lab assignments. More detailed lab descriptions are available on the web. Specifically for Volume 1, look at the lab assignments for EE319K. For Volume 2 refer to the EE445L labs, and for this volume, look at the lab assignments for EE345M/EE380L.6. There is a web site accompanying this book http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/arm. Posted here are Keil uVision projects for each the example programs in the book. You will also find data sheets and Excel spreadsheets relevant to the material in this book. The book will cover embedded systems for the ARM\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3 with specific details on the LM3S811, LM3S1968, and LM3S8962. Most of the topics can be run on the simple LM3S811. DMA interfacing will be presented on the LM3S3748. Ethernet and CAN examples can be run on the LM3S8962. In this book the term LM3Sxxx family will refer to any of the Texas Instruments Stellaris\ufffd ARM\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3-based microcontrollers.

Taking a structural\ufffdbiophysical approach, the authors discuss the molecular interactions and thermodynamic changes that transpire in these highly complex molecules. The text incorporates various biochemical, physical, functional, and medical aspects. It covers different levels of protein structure, current methods for structure determination, energetics of protein structure, protein folding and folded state dynamics, and the functions of intrinsically unstructured proteins. The authors also clarify the structure\ufffdfunction relationship of proteins by presenting the principles of protein action in the form of guidelines. This comprehensive, color book uses numerous proteins as examples to illustrate the topics and principles and to show how proteins can be analyzed in multiple ways. It refers to many everyday applications of proteins and enzymes in medical disorders, drugs, toxins, chemical warfare, and animal behavior.

Scott Rosenberg's Dreaming in Code draws on Kidder's model as it attempts to document the state of software, the Internet, and everything circa 2006 through the lens of Chandler, an as-yet-unfinished software application for the management of personal information. The Chandler project--driven by Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development and main author of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, and later co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation--isn't the primary point of Dreaming in Code, though reading about software people and their social behavior is at least as interesting as reading about that of meerkats or monkeys. Rather, Chandler is a rhetorical device with which Rosenberg takes on the big questions: How do software development teams work (or not)? Why does the reuse of software modules rarely work altogether correctly? Does open-source development by volunteers on the Internet lead to innovation or just insanely bifurcated chaos? Chandler helps his readers think more clearly about all of these issues; however, \"answers\" to these questions are, of course, not to be had, which is one of his points. The problem with books about technical subjects that aspire to appeal to a general audience, particularly computers and software, is that such subjects are so far outside the realm of familiarity of most people that the prose bogs down in analogy and metaphor. Rosenberg manages to avoid too much of that and deliver a readable account of software development and culture. --David Wall", "title_latin": "Dreaming in Code", "physical_description_text": "416 pages", "language": "", "category": "practice", "authors": "Rosenberg, Scott", "book_id": "dreaming_in_code_a01", "marc_enc_level": "~", "publisher_name": "Three Rivers Press", "publisher_id": "three_rivers_press", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9781400082476", "notes": ""}, {"subject_ids": ["computer_multitasking1", "parallel_programming_computer_science1"], "awards_text": "; ", "lcc_number": "Web Link", "dewey_normal": "0", "isbn10": "1937785653", "dewey_decimal": "", "publisher_text": "; Pragmatic Bookshelf", "title_long": "Seven concurrency models in seven weekswhen threads unravel", "topic": "seven", "shelf": "9.-1", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "; ", "title": "Seven concurrency models in seven weeks", "author_data": [{"id": "butcher_paul_n", "name": "Butcher, Paul N."}], "isbn13": "9781937785659", "title_latin": "Seven concurrency models in seven weeks", "summary": "", "physical_description_text": "xiii, 275 pages :", "language": "eng", "category": "languages", "authors": "Butcher, Paul N.", "book_id": "seven_concurrency_models_in_seven_weeks", "marc_enc_level": "", "publisher_name": "Pragmatic Bookshelf", "publisher_id": "pragmatic_bookshelf", "copies": 1, "notes": "Includes bibliographical references and index.; Introduction -- Threads and locks -- Functional programming -- The Clojure way: separating identity from state -- Actors -- Communicating sequential processes -- Data parallelism -- The Lambda Architecture -- Wrapping up."}, {"subject_ids": ["computers_internet_programming_algorithms", "computers_internet_programming_languages_tools"], "awards_text": "", "lcc_number": "", "dewey_normal": "1.642", "isbn10": "0201038048", "dewey_decimal": "001.642", "publisher_text": "Addison-Wesley Professional", "title_long": "The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A: Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1 (Series in Computer Science & Information Processing)", "topic": "computer science", "shelf": "4.1", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "Hardcover; 2011-01-24", "title": "The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A: Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1", "author_data": [{"id": "knuth_donald_ervin", "name": "Knuth, Donald Ervin"}], "title_latin": "The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A: Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1", "summary": "Knuth\ufffds multivolume analysis of algorithms is widely recognized as the definitive description of classical computer science. The first three volumes of this work have long comprised a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of Knuth\ufffds analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his \ufffdcookbook\ufffd solutions to their day-to-day problems. The level of these first three volumes has remained so high, and they have displayed so wide and deep a familiarity with the art of computer programming, that a sufficient \ufffdreview\ufffd of future volumes could almost be: \ufffdKnuth, Volume n has been published.\ufffd \ufffdData Processing Digest Knuth, Volume n has been published, where n = 4A. In this long-awaited new volume, the old master turns his attention to some of his favorite topics in broadword computation and combinatorial generation (exhaustively listing fundamental combinatorial objects, such as permutations, partitions, and trees), as well as his more recent interests, such as binary decision diagrams. The hallmark qualities that distinguish his previous volumes are manifest here anew: detailed coverage of the basics, illustrated with well-chosen examples; occasional forays into more esoteric topics and problems at the frontiers of research; impeccable writing peppered with occasional bits of humor; extensive collections of exercises, all with solutions or helpful hints; a careful attention to history; implementations of many of the algorithms in his classic step-by-step form. There is an amazing amount of information on each page. Knuth has obviously thought long and hard about which topics and results are most central and important, and then, what are the most intuitive and succinct ways of presenting that material. Since the areas that he covers in this volume have exploded since he first envisioned writing about them, it is wonderful how he has managed to provide such thorough treatment in so few pages. \ufffdFrank Ruskey, Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria The book is Volume 4A, because Volume 4 has itself become a multivolume undertaking. Combinatorial searching is a rich and important topic, and Knuth has too much to say about it that is new, interesting, and useful to fit into a single volume, or two, or maybe even three. This book alone includes approximately 1500 exercises, with answers for self-study, plus hundreds of useful facts that cannot be found in any other publication.

The discipline that addresses these structures, which is called structured finance or securitization, is almost twenty years old, and has become a pervasive element of modern financial management. Yet, it has not been systematically covered in a textbook designed for both the school and workplace contexts. The Elements of Structured Finance, the text version of a program of instruction in structured finance that the authors have offered at NYU and Hong Kong University, as well as in private training programs and consultancies, fills this void spectacularly. Raynes and Rutledge, two very highly regarded teachers and consultants in the field, bring clarity and logic to an inherently complex and frightening area of finance, using their extensive experience working with many of the top Wall Street securities houses. The book begins with the relatively simple concepts of static valuation models and the benchmark pool, and takes the reader through the more esoteric features of dynamic risk analysis, thus serving as both an introduction for the beginner and a helpful reference for the professional.

With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, The Elements of Computing Systems gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system. Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture. Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.

It's used worldwide by companies who need to produce reliable, efficient, and scalable applications. Invest in learning Erlang now. Moore's Law is the observation that the amount you can do on a single chip doubles every two years. But Moore's Law is taking a detour. Rather than producing faster and faster processors, companies such as Intel and AMD are producing multi-core devices: single chips containing two, four, or more processors. If your programs aren't concurrent, they'll only run on a single processor at a time. Your users will think that your code is slow. Erlang is a programming language designed for building highly parallel, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. It has been used commercially for many years to build massive fault-tolerated systems that run for years with minimal failures. Erlang programs run seamlessly on multi-core computers: this means your Erlang program should run a lot faster on a 4 core processor than on a single core processor, all without you having to change a line of code. Erlang combines ideas from the world of functional programming with techniques for building fault-tolerant systems to make a powerful language for building the massively parallel, networked applications of the future. This book presents Erlang and functional programming in the familiar Pragmatic style. And it's written by Joe Armstrong, one of the creators of Erlang. It includes example code you'll be able to build upon. In addition, the book contains the full source code for two interesting applications: A SHOUTcast server which you can use to stream music to every computer in your house, and a full-text indexing and search engine that can index gigabytes of data. Learn how to write programs that run on dozens or even hundreds of local and remote processors. See how to write robust applications that run even in the face of network and hardware failure, using the Erlang programming language.", "physical_description_text": "550 pages", "language": "", "category": "languages", "authors": "Armstrong, Joe", "book_id": "programming_erlang", "marc_enc_level": "~", "publisher_name": "Pragmatic Bookshelf", "publisher_id": "pragmatic_bookshelf", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9781934356005", "notes": ""}, {"subject_ids": ["neurophysiology", "psychophysiology"], "awards_text": "", "lcc_number": "QP356", "dewey_normal": "0", "isbn10": "0262521121", "dewey_decimal": "", "publisher_text": "Cambridge, Mass. : MIT Press, c1984.", "title_long": "", "topic": "tech history", "shelf": "3.1", "urls_text": "", "edition_info": "(pbk.)", "title": "Vehicles, experiments in synthetic psychology", "author_data": [{"id": "braitenberg_valentino", "name": "Braitenberg, Valentino"}], "summary": "", "title_latin": "Vehicles, experiments in synthetic psychology", "physical_description_text": "x, 152 p. : ill. ; 21 cm.", "language": "eng", "category": "other subjects", "authors": "Braitenberg, Valentino", "book_id": "vehicles_experiments_in_synthetic_psychology_a01", "marc_enc_level": "", "publisher_name": "MIT Press", "publisher_id": "mit_press", "copies": 1, "isbn13": "9780262521123", "notes": "\"Bradford books\"--P.

Valvano"}], "summary": "This book is the second in a series of three books that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to the ARM\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3. The three books are primarily written for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students. They could also be used for professionals learning the Arm platform. The first book Embedded Systems: Introduction to the ARM\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3 is an introduction to computers and interfacing focusing on assembly language and C programming. This second book focuses on interfacing and the design of embedded systems. The third book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for the ARM\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3 is an advanced book focusing on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics. An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. Topics include microcontrollers, design, verification, hardware/software synchronization, interfacing devices to the computer, timing diagrams, real-time systems, data collection and processing, motor control, analog filters, digital filters, and real-time signal processing. In general, the area of embedded systems is an important and growing discipline within electrical and computer engineering. The educational market of embedded system is dominated by simple microcontrollers like the PIC, the 9S12, and the 8051. This is because of their market share, low cost, and historical dominance. However, as problems become more complex, so must the systems that solve them. A number of embedded system paradigms must shift in order to accommodate this growth in complexity. First, the number of calculation per second will increase from about 1 million/sec to 1 billion/sec. Similarly, the number of lines of software code will also increase from 1000\ufffds to 10 to 100 million. Thirdly, systems will involve multiple microcontrollers supporting many simultaneous operations. Lastly, the need for system verification will continue to grow as these systems are deployed into safety critical applications. These changes are more than a simple growth in size and bandwidth. These systems must employ parallel programming, DMA synchronization, real-time operating systems, fault tolerant design, priority interrupt handling, and networking. Consequently, it will be important to provide our students with these types of design experiences. The Arm platform is both low cost and provides the high performance features required in future embedded systems. Although the Arm market share is currently not huge, its share will grow. Furthermore, students trained on the Arm will be equipped to design systems across the complete spectrum from simple to complex. The purpose of writing this book at this time is to bring engineering education into the 21st century. This book employs many approaches to learning. It will not include an exhaustive recapitulation of the information in data sheets. First, it begins with basic fundamentals, which allows the reader to solve new problems with new technology. Second, the book presents many detailed design examples. These examples illustrate the process of design. There are multiple structural components that assist learning. Checkpoints, with answers in the back, are short easy to answer questions providing immediate feedback while reading. Simple homework, with answers to the odd questions on the web, provide more detailed learning opportunities. The book includes an index and a glossary so that information can be searched. The most important learning experience in a class like this are of course the laboratories. Each chapter has suggested lab assignments. More detailed lab descriptions are available on the web. The book will cover embedded systems for the Arm\ufffd Cortex\ufffd-M3 with specific details on the LM3S811, LM3S1968 and LM3S8962.

Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care? Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet. Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls \"an intellectual Wild West.\" The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live.
