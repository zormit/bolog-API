In a clear, direct style, Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos teach students to analyze and define problems for themselves, and from this to recognize which design principles are appropriate for a given situation. The text encourages a greater understanding of the algorithm design process and an appreciation of the role of algorithms in the broader field of computer science.\"--BOOK JACKET.", "book_id": "algorithm_design_a02", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "", "edition_info": "(alk. paper)", "subject_ids": ["computer_algorithms", "data_structures_computer_science"], "lcc_number": "QA76.9", "isbn13": "9780321295354", "physical_description_text": "xxiii, 838 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.", "title_latin": "Algorithm design", "author_data": [{"name": "Jon Kleinberg", "id": "jon_kleinberg"}, {"name": "\ufffdva Tardos", "id": "eva_tardos"}, {"name": "Tardos, ?va", "id": "tardos_shva"}], "title": "Algorithm design", "shelf": "4.4"}
