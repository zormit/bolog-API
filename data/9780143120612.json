With 174 million gamers in the United States alone, we now live in a world where every generation will be a gamer generation. But why, Jane McGonigal asks, should games be used for escapist entertainment alone? In this groundbreaking book, she shows how we can leverage the power of games to fix what is wrong with the real world-from social problems like depression and obesity to global issues like poverty and climate change-and introduces us to cutting-edge games that are already changing the business, education, and nonprofit worlds. Written for gamers and non-gamers alike, Reality Is Broken shows that the future will belong to those who can understand, design, and play games.", "book_id": "reality_is_broken_a02", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2011-12-27", "subject_ids": ["computers_technology_games_strategy_guides_video_games", "humor_entertainment_puzzles_games_video_electronic_games", "science_math_behavioral_sciences_cognitive_psychology", "politics_social_sciences_social_sciences"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9780143120612", "physical_description_text": "5.4\"x8.4\"x1.0\"; 0.7 lb; 416 pages", "title_latin": "Reality Is Broken", "author_data": [{"name": "Jane McGonigal", "id": "jane_mcgonigal"}], "title": "Reality Is Broken", "shelf": "1.3"}
