This book introduces you to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, its implications, and how it should affect your play. Other chapters discuss the value of deception, bluffing, raising, the slow-play, the value of position, psychology, heads-up play, game theory, implied odds, the free card, and semibluffing. Many of today?s top poker players will tell you that this is the book that really made a difference in their play. That is, these are the ideas that separate the experts from the typical players.
