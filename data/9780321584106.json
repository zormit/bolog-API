In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do\ufffdso you can leverage its immense, surprising power. Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the \ufffdAh Ha!\ufffd moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language\ufffds elegance and expressiveness. Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You\ufffdll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for. Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You\ufffdll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code\ufffdand why you\ufffdll want to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain Specific Languages.
