Scott Rosenberg's Dreaming in Code draws on Kidder's model as it attempts to document the state of software, the Internet, and everything circa 2006 through the lens of Chandler, an as-yet-unfinished software application for the management of personal information. The Chandler project--driven by Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development and main author of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, and later co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation--isn't the primary point of Dreaming in Code, though reading about software people and their social behavior is at least as interesting as reading about that of meerkats or monkeys. Rather, Chandler is a rhetorical device with which Rosenberg takes on the big questions: How do software development teams work (or not)? Why does the reuse of software modules rarely work altogether correctly? Does open-source development by volunteers on the Internet lead to innovation or just insanely bifurcated chaos? Chandler helps his readers think more clearly about all of these issues; however, \"answers\" to these questions are, of course, not to be had, which is one of his points. The problem with books about technical subjects that aspire to appeal to a general audience, particularly computers and software, is that such subjects are so far outside the realm of familiarity of most people that the prose bogs down in analogy and metaphor. Rosenberg manages to avoid too much of that and deliver a readable account of software development and culture. --David Wall", "book_id": "dreaming_in_code_a01", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2008-02-26", "subject_ids": [], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781400082476", "physical_description_text": "416 pages", "title_latin": "Dreaming in Code", "author_data": [{"name": "Rosenberg, Scott", "id": "rosenberg_scott"}], "title": "Dreaming in Code", "shelf": "2.3"}
