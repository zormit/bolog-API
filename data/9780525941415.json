At the center of this fascinating story is Andy Grove, Intel's high-profile CEO and chairman, once a penniless immigrant who waited tables to put himself through college. Drawing on court records, previously unpublished documents, and over a hundred interviews with important figures from Intel's history, Inside Intel is a meticulously researched behind-the-scenes look at this computer giant's brilliant successes, spectacular failures, and incredible inventions and groundbreaking products. It is also a personal saga of the powerful human emotions behind the struggles that have made Intel one of the most competitive players in a high-stakes game of money, power, and ambition.", "book_id": "inside_intel", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "", "edition_info": "", "subject_ids": ["grove_andrew_s", "intel_corporation", "semiconductor_industry_united_states", "high_technology_industries_united_states_management", "technological_innovations_economic_aspects_united_states", "corporations_united_states", "chief_executive_officers_united_states"], "lcc_number": "HD9696", "isbn13": "9780525941415", "physical_description_text": "vi, 424 p. ; 24 cm.", "title_latin": "Inside Intel", "author_data": [{"name": "Jackson, Tim", "id": "jackson_tim"}], "title": "Inside Intel", "shelf": "3.1"}
