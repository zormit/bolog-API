In Typographic Systems, Kim Elam, author of our bestselling books, Geometry of Design and Grid Systems, explores eight major structural systems beyond the traditional ordering systems of the grid \ufffd including random, radial, modular, and bilateral systems. By taking the reader through exercises, student work, and professional examples, Elam offers a broad range of design solutions. Once essential visual organization systems are understood the designer can fluidly organize words or images within a structure, combination of structures, or a variation of a structure. With clarity and substance, each system \ufffd from the structured axis to the nonhierarchical radial array \ufffd is explained and explored so that the reader comes away with a better understanding of these intricate complex arrangements. Typographic Systems is the sixth title in our bestselling Design Briefs series, which has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide.", "book_id": "typographic_systems", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2007-04-19", "subject_ids": [], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781568986876", "physical_description_text": "159 pages", "title_latin": "Typographic Systems", "author_data": [{"name": "Elam, Kimberly", "id": "elam_kimberly"}], "title": "Typographic Systems", "shelf": "3.2"}
