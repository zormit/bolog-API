In general, statistical techniques allow automatic translation systems to be built quickly for any language-pair using only translated texts and generic software. With increasing globalization, statistical machine translation will be central to communication and commerce. Based on courses and tutorials, and classroom-tested globally, it is ideal for instruction or self-study, for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science and/or computational linguistics, and researchers in natural language processing. The companion website provides open-source corpora and tool-kits.", "book_id": "statistical_machine_translation", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Hardcover; 2010-01-31", "subject_ids": ["computers_internet_software_natural_language_processing", "computers_internet_general", "reference_words_language_linguistics", "reference_words_language_translating", "science_mathematics_applied_probability_statistics"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9780521874151", "physical_description_text": "6.8\"x9.8\"x1.0\"; 2.4 lb; 488 pages", "title_latin": "Statistical Machine Translation", "author_data": [{"name": "Philipp Koehn", "id": "philipp_koehn"}], "title": "Statistical Machine Translation", "shelf": "7.3"}
