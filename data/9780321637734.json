A thorough knowledge of system calls is essential for every UNIX and Linux programmer -- and for 20 years, W. Richard Stevens' Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment has delivered that. Now, Stephen Rago has completely updated this classic to reflect modern distributions including Red Hat 2.6.x, Solaris 10 3, OS X 10.5.4, FreeBSD 7.0.5 -- and for the first time, Ubuntu. As in previous editions, Rago begins with essentials such as file and process control, carefully laying the groundwork for more advanced techniques. He supports his crystal-clear explanations with nearly 10,000 lines of code, all carefully tested on each of these leading versions and distributions. Rago begins with an up-to-date overview of the UNIX System, its standardization processes, and its diverse implementations. Next, he introduces file I/O, files, directories, and the Standard I/O Library. You'll walk through working with UNIX/Linux system data files and information\ufffd controlling the process environment and its relationships\ufffd using signals, threads, and daemon processes\ufffd mastering advanced I/O techniques, interprocess communication, sockets, and advanced IPC\ufffd using Terminal I/O and Pseudo Terminals\ufffd working with database libraries, communicating with network printers, and much more. Appendices provide essential information on function prototypes, miscellaneous source code, and solutions to many of this guide's exercises.
