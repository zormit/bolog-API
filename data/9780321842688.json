Warren\ufffds hacks are eminently practical, but they\ufffdre also intrinsically interesting, and sometimes unexpected, much like the solution to a great puzzle. They are, in a word, a delight to any programmer who is excited by the opportunity to improve. Extensive additions in this edition include A new chapter on cyclic redundancy checking (CRC), including routines for the commonly used CRC-32 code A new chapter on error correcting codes (ECC), including routines for the Hamming code More coverage of integer division by constants, including methods using only shifts and adds Computing remainders without computing a quotient More coverage of population count and counting leading zeros Array population count New algorithms for compress and expand An LRU algorithm Floating-point to/from integer conversions Approximate floating-point reciprocal square root routine A gallery of graphs of discrete functions Now with exercises and answers", "book_id": "hackers_delight_a01", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Hardcover; 2012-09-25", "subject_ids": ["computers_technology_business_culture_hacking", "computers_technology_programming_algorithms", "education_reference"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9780321842688", "physical_description_text": "6.6\"x9.4\"x1.2\"; 1.9 lb; 512 pages", "title_latin": "Hacker's Delight", "author_data": [{"name": "Warren, Henry White", "id": "warren_henry_white"}], "title": "Hacker's Delight", "shelf": "4.2"}
