It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although I use Python as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems.", "book_id": "python_programming", "copies": 2, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2003-12", "subject_ids": [], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781887902991", "physical_description_text": "", "title_latin": "Python Programming", "author_data": [{"name": "John M.
