Upon mastering this material, you will be familiar with the different kinds of device drivers used under Linux, and know the appropriate API's through which devices (both hard and soft) interface with the kernel. The purpose is to get you into coding as quickly as possible. Thus we'll tell you early on how to dynamically allocate memory in the simplest way, so you can actually write code, and then later cover the subject more thoroughly. Each section has exercises, most of which involve writing code, designed to help you gain familiarity with programming for the Linux kernel. Solutions are provided. We are not aiming for an expert audience, but instead for a competent and motivated one.", "book_id": "writing_linux_device_drivers_a_guide_with_exercises", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2009-09-03", "subject_ids": ["computers_internet_operating_systems_linux_programming", "computers_internet_operating_systems_linux_general", "computers_internet_programming_apis_operating_environments_d", "computers_internet_programming_software_design_testing_engin"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781448672387", "physical_description_text": "7.4\"x9.6\"x1.1\"; 1.9 lb; 394 pages", "title_latin": "Writing Linux Device Drivers: a guide with exercises", "author_data": [{"name": "Dr Jerry Cooperstein", "id": "dr_jerry_cooperstein"}], "title": "Writing Linux Device Drivers: a guide with exercises", "shelf": "9.4"}
