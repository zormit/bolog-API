Describing the C language more clearly and in more detail than any other book, authors Samuel P. Harbison and Guy L. Steele Jr. provide in a single manual: Standard C - the ANSI/ISO standard now supported by all new C compilers; Traditional C - common practice for twenty years, with millions of lines of code in use every day and the complete Standard and Traditional C run-time libraries. Thoroughly revised and updated, the Fourth Edition adds two important developments: the ANSI/ISO description has been updated with ISO C Amendment 1 (1994), which adds new facilities for writing portable international programs and each language chapter now discusses C++ compatibility, so you can write C programs that will be maximally portable and reusable in C and C++ environments - an important consideration for software developers.", "book_id": "c_a_reference_manual_a07", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "", "edition_info": "(pbk.)", "subject_ids": ["c_computer_program_language"], "lcc_number": "QA76.73", "isbn13": "9780133262247", "physical_description_text": "xx, 455 p. : ill. ; 23 cm.", "title_latin": "C, a reference manual", "author_data": [{"name": "Harbison, Samuel P.", "id": "harbison_samuel_p"}, {"name": "Steele, Guy L.", "id": "steele_guy_l"}], "title": "C, a reference manual", "shelf": "9.-1"}
