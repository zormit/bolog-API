The Joy of Clojure goes beyond the syntax, and shows how to write fluent, idiomatic Clojure code. Readers will learn to approach programming challenges from a Functional perspective and master the Lisp techniques that make Clojure so elegant and efficient. According to the authors, there's a \"right way\" to do things in Clojure. This book will help readers think about problems the \"Clojure way,\" and recognize when they simply need to change the way they program. Not just another book about programming philosophy, The Joy of Clojure tackles hard software areas like concurrency, interoperability, performance, and more.", "book_id": "the_joy_of_clojure", "copies": 4, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2010-11-30", "subject_ids": ["computers_internet_home_computing_internet_general", "computers_internet_programming_general"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781935182641", "physical_description_text": "300 pages", "title_latin": "The Joy of Clojure", "author_data": [{"name": "Michael Fogus", "id": "michael_fogus"}, {"name": "Chris Houser", "id": "chris_houser"}], "title": "The Joy of Clojure", "shelf": "5.4"}
