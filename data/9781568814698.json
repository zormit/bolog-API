This edition of \"Fundamentals of Computer Graphics\" adds four new contributed chapters and contains substantial reorganizations and improvements to the core material. The new chapters add coverage of implicit modeling and of two important graphics applications: games and information visualization. The fourth new contributed chapter is a major upgrade to the material on color science. As with the chapters added in the second edition, we have chosen the contributors both for their expertise and for their clear way of expressing ideas.", "book_id": "fundamentals_of_computer_graphics_a01", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Hardcover; 2009-07-21", "subject_ids": ["computers_internet_games_strategy_guides_video_games", "computers_internet_graphic_design_general", "computers_internet_programming_algorithms_pattern_recognitio", "computers_internet_programming_graphics_multimedia_general", "computers_internet_programming_general", "computers_internet_web_development_web_design_web_graphics", "computers_internet_general", "entertainment_puzzles_games_video_electronic_games"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781568814698", "physical_description_text": "7.6\"x9.4\"x1.6\"; 3.4 lb; 804 pages", "title_latin": "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics", "author_data": [{"name": "Peter Shirley", "id": "peter_shirley"}, {"name": "Steve Marschner", "id": "steve_marschner"}], "title": "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics", "shelf": "6.4"}
