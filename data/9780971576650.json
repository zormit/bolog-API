It focuses in underlying ideas, integrates theory and applications, offers a host of learning aids, features coverage of differential forms, and emphasizes numerical methods that highlight modern applications of mathematics. The revised and expanded content of this edition includes new discussions of functions; complex numbers; closure, interior, and boundary; orientation; forms restricted to vector spaces; expanded discussions of subsets and subspaces of R^n; probability, change of basis matrix; and more.
