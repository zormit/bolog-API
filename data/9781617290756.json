When a user clicks on a link, the site reacts slowly because the browser sends information to the server and the server sends it back again before displaying the results. With near universal availability of capable browsers and powerful hardware, the single page web application (SPA) pushes most of the code to the browser, giving users immediate results, whether they're surfing at their desk or using a phone app.Single Page Web Applications shows how to build modern browser-based apps that take advantage of stronger client platforms and more-predictable bandwidth. It covers the SPA design approach and explores new techniques like structured JavaScript and responsive design. Readers will learn to capitalize on trends like server-side JavaScript and NoSQL data stores, as well as new frameworks that make JavaScript more manageable and testable as a first-class language. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.", "book_id": "single_page_web_applications", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2013-02-28", "subject_ids": ["computers_technology_home_computing_internet", "computers_technology_databases_database_management_systems", "computers_technology_microsoft", "computers_technology_programming_languages_tools", "computers_technology_web_development_programming", "education_reference"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781617290756", "physical_description_text": "325 pages", "title_latin": "Single Page Web Applications", "author_data": [{"name": "Michael Mikowski", "id": "michael_mikowski"}, {"name": "Powell, Josh", "id": "powell_josh"}], "title": "Single Page Web Applications", "shelf": "9.1"}
