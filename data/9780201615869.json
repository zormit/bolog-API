The practice of programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves and others. At the same time, they must be concerned with issues like compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications. The Practice of Programming covers all these topics, and more. This book is full of practical advice and real-world examples in C, C++, Java, and a variety of special-purpose languages.", "book_id": "the_practice_of_programming", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "", "edition_info": "", "subject_ids": ["computer_programming"], "lcc_number": "QA76.6", "isbn13": "9780201615869", "physical_description_text": "xii, 267 p. ; 24 cm.", "title_latin": "practice of programming", "author_data": [{"name": "Kernighan, Brian W.", "id": "kernighan_brian_w"}, {"name": "Pike, Rob", "id": "pike_rob"}], "title": "The practice of programming", "shelf": "2.3"}
