Parents, teachers, bosses, and institutions all give less encouragement to women than men, and women still grow up believing that they must defer to men in order be seen as feminine. If their ambition does survive into adulthood, too often those ambitions must be downsized or abandoned to accommodate \ufffdwifely\ufffd duties of household chores and child care. As a result, women--unlike men\ufffdcontinually have to re-shape their goals and expectations.Yet expressing ambition, pursuing it, and getting recognition for one\ufffds accomplishments is critical to identity and happiness. In this groundbreaking work, Anna Fels draws on extensive research and years of her psychiatriac practice to offer an original and deeply useful examination of ambition in women\ufffds lives. In the process, she illuminates just what is necessary for women to articulate--and fulfill--their dreams.", "book_id": "necessary_dreams_a01", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Paperback; 2005-02-08", "subject_ids": ["nonfiction_social_sciences_sociology_general", "nonfiction_womens_studies_general"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9780679758884", "physical_description_text": "4.9\"x7.7\"x0.8\"; 0.5 lb; 320 pages", "title_latin": "Necessary Dreams", "author_data": [{"name": "ANNA FELS", "id": "anna_fels"}], "title": "Necessary Dreams", "shelf": "2.4"}
