With more than 350 color images throughout, Introduction to Proteins: Structure, Function, and Motion presents a unified, in-depth treatment of the relationship between the structure, dynamics, and function of proteins. Taking a structural\ufffdbiophysical approach, the authors discuss the molecular interactions and thermodynamic changes that transpire in these highly complex molecules. The text incorporates various biochemical, physical, functional, and medical aspects. It covers different levels of protein structure, current methods for structure determination, energetics of protein structure, protein folding and folded state dynamics, and the functions of intrinsically unstructured proteins. The authors also clarify the structure\ufffdfunction relationship of proteins by presenting the principles of protein action in the form of guidelines. This comprehensive, color book uses numerous proteins as examples to illustrate the topics and principles and to show how proteins can be analyzed in multiple ways. It refers to many everyday applications of proteins and enzymes in medical disorders, drugs, toxins, chemical warfare, and animal behavior. Questions for each chapter are available for download on the CRC Press website.", "book_id": "introduction_to_proteins_structure_function_and_motion", "copies": 1, "awards_text": "", "marc_enc_level": "~", "edition_info": "Hardcover; 2010-10-22", "subject_ids": ["science_biological_sciences_biochemistry"], "lcc_number": "", "isbn13": "9781439810712", "physical_description_text": "636 pages", "title_latin": "Introduction to Proteins: Structure, Function, and Motion", "author_data": [{"name": "Amit Kessel", "id": "amit_kessel"}, {"name": "Nir Ben-Tal", "id": "nir_ben_tal"}], "title": "Introduction to Proteins: Structure, Function, and Motion", "shelf": "1.3"}
